      # Notes:
      # - You can't install anything with conda which conflicts the versions
      #   pinned in coiled-runtime. Pip packages ignore these restrictions.
      # - You can point to your own git fork instead
      # For example, if you want to test a PR before it's merged into main, you should
      # change this to the dask/dask and/or dask/distributed git tip
